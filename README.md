# FACEIT Visuals

> Browser extension that brings more statistics and allows players for a smooth lifestyle on the platform

FaceitVisuals was  created using -[FACEIT ENHANCER ](https://github.com/repeekgg) src when  got broken after Faceit Updated their platform. 

I wanted to bring back the tools we had and after fixing some features of the old one , I started creating some new features on this one ( BanHistory,FaceitOnSteamprofiles, Distinctive Badges for VIP's)
